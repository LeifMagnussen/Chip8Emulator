# Chip8Emulator
Chip8 Emulator designed by following @Laurence Muller's tutorial (http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/). I Wrote this to help learn the actions of a CPU as its executing operation codes, and to supplement the material learned during my third year of electrical engineering
